My dot files
 - if ever using firefox, consider doing the following:
  - cp the ```./chrome/userChrome.css``` to ```/home/$USER/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE_PATH/chrome```
  - navigate to about:config, search for 'userprof' and change the 'toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets' to true.

The reason being firefox acts weird when in fullscreen via i3wm, this prevents the toolbar from disappearing when in fullscreen.
